# What is a Queue?
- Ordered list in which insertions are done ate one end (read) and deletions are done at other end( front).
- Works on FIFO principle
- Insertion: EnQueue
- Deletion: DeQueue
- Dequeueing an empty queue is called underflow and Enqueueing an element in a full queue is called overflow

## Applications
- Operating Systems: Scheduling jobs
- Asynchronous Data Transfer

## Implementation
- Simple circular array based
- Dynamic circular array based
- Linked list based
