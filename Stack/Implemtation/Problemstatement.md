# Implementation of stack using many methods
## Simple Array based implementation
- Add elements from left to right and use a variable to keep track of the index of the top element
- The array storing the stack elements may become full. A push operation will then throw a full stack exception. Similarly, if we try deleting an element from an empty stack it will throw stack empty exception.
