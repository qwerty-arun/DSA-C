# Algorithm:
- Move the top n – 1 disks from Source to Auxiliary tower,
- Move the nth disk from Source to Destination tower,
- Move the n – 1 disks from Auxiliary tower to Destination tower.
- Transferring the top n – 1 disks from Source to Auxiliary tower can again be thought of as a fresh problem and can be solved in the same manner. Once we solve Towers of Hanoi with three disks, we can solve it with any number of disks with the above algorithm.
